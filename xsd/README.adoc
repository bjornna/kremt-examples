# RM Types

openEHR https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/Release-1.0.4/[RM] XML schema - openEHR Release-1.0.4.

These are only type schemas, they do not validate directly any XML document or elements.

### Transformation Rules

The following mapping rules were used in order to create the schema from the reference model.

#### Basic type mappings
The basic types utilise the internal XML simpleTypes in accordance with the assumed types section in the Support IM.  
Some changes have been made to the reference model to accommodate these standards; see schema for DV_DATE_TIME, DV_DATE, DV_TIME, DV_DURATION.

#### Generic types
The openEHR reference model makes use of generic types - including DV_INTERVAL<T> (Data types IM) and VERSION<T> (Common IM) for example. 
As generic types are now available in C# and Java this is warranted for implementation specifications. Generic types are not available in XML Schema.

|===============================================
|Reference model type    |XML Schema complexType
|Interval<Integer>       |IntervalOfInteger (BaseTypes.xsd)
|Interval<Real>          |IntervalOfReal (BaseTypes.xsd)
|Interval<Date>          |IntervalOfDate (BaseTypes.xsd)
|Interval<Time>          |IntervalOfTime (BaseTypes.xsd)
|Interval<DateTime>      |IntervalOfDateTime (BaseTypes.xsd)
|Interval<Duration>      |IntervalOfDuration (BaseTypes.xsd)
|DV_INTERVAL<DV_ORDERED> |DV_INTERVAL (BaseTypes.xsd)
|VERSION<T>	             |VERSION, ORIGINAL_VERSION (Version.xsd)
|===============================================

For DV_INTERVAL<DV_ORDERED> only one type is used, namely DV_INTERVAL, with lower and upper of type DV_ORDERED. Software implementations 
of the relevant generic types (DV_INTERVAL<DV_DATE> etc) are expected to implement further typing sensibly.

For VERSION<T> only one type is used, namely VERSION. The subtype ORIGINAL_VERSION has its data attribute of type LOCATABLE.

#### Multiple Inheritance
There are a couple of places where multiple inheritance occurs in the openEHR reference model. In all cases, only one inheritance branch corresponds 
to subtyping in the substitutability (i.e. 'is-a') sense; the other branches are always 'facility'  or 'mix-in' inheritance. In the RM, classes 
inheriting in this way include rm.data_types.quantity.DV_INTERVAL and the rm.data_types.quantity.date_time classes. The latter inherit only interface, 
which has no visibility in XML-schema. For the former, the inheritance of Interval<T> by DV_INTERVAL<T> is done in the schema simply by direct 
inclusion, since the other branch of inheritance (of DATA_VALUE) is the one which must be visible to schema processing.

#### Conditional Rules
In instance data, LOCATABLE.archetype_details (of type ARCHETYPED) is only included when template_id exists, since the archetype_id attribute from 
ARCHETYPED is included by default as the value of LOCATABLE.archetype_node_id on archetype root-point LOCATABLE instances (top of a SECTION structure, 
OBSERVATION structure etc).

#### XML Attributes and Elements
XML attributes are not used with the exception of the LOCATABLE.archetype_node_id RM attribute, which is, from the point of view of RM classes, 
true meta-data. Making it an attribute allows archetype paths to be easily mapped to Xpaths.
